# NET-ORION Bridge/Router project

This is a Linux network project I'm working on just for fun.
The goal is to create a bridge or router with DPI feature.

## Notes
- The VM will initially act as a basic router, ready for further configuration.
- We will later add more features (starting by DPI)
- You can create a qemu/kvm image using scripts/vm_setup/ Check README.md in this folder
